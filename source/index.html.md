# Introduction

Welcome to the ChunkyBorgar API! You can use our API and documentation to help you be successful for this exercise.

The goal of this exercise is to provide some exposure to some processes we have here at PayIt and also simplified versions of some of the problems have to solve.

# Exercise

A ChonkyBorgar order has been placed however the payment failed and will need to be resubmitting using this API, however it's not entirely finished yet and some additions may need to be made.

## 1
An order was placed on 02/02/2020 at 09:16 PM Central Standard Time. Funds were never collected for the order, so we're needing look up the order and submit a transaction.
# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here" \
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
